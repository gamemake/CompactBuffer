# CompactBuffer

Binary serialization implemented in pure C#.

# Why use Compact Bufferï¼Ÿ

* No type reflection is used.
* Support Span type to reduce GC.
* Simple and easy to use.

# Install to unity project

On Windows
```dos
cd Unity
Build.bat
./CopyDllTo.bat ${UNITY_PROJECT_DIR}\Assets\CompactBuffer
```

On MacOS
```bash
cd Unity
./Build.sh
./CopyDllTo.sh ${UNITY_PROJECT_DIR}/Assets/CompactBuffer
```

# How to use it?
Pure C# binary data serialze

Compact Buffer
```cs
[CompactBufferGenCode]
public class LiveData
{
    public Guid guid;
    public string UserName;
}

var serailizer = CompactBuffer.GetSerializer<LiveData>();
var bytes = new byte[1000];
var writer = new BufferWriter(bytes);
var liveData = new LiveData();
serializer.Write(writer, ref liveData);
var reader = new BufferReader(bytes, 0, writer.Length);
liveData = null;
serializer.Read(reader, ref liveData);
```

Protocol

```cs
```

Protocol Proxy

```cs
```

Protocol Stub

```cs
```

# Float16

```cs
public struct Location
{
    [Float16(1000)]
    public Vector3 Position;
    [Float16(1)]
    public Vector3 Direction;
}
```

The original Vector3 occupies 12 bytes, and after adding the Float16 Attribute, it occupies 6 bytes. Of course, there is a loss in accuracy.
